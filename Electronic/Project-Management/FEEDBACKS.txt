PRELIMINARY MEETING (18/12/15) : 
- Good comments on interactivity, must continue in this direction to avoid a boring game (see last year) (Vinz idea : minigame for player B when not in combat)
- Not necessary to make the map with tiles, we could do it without (free movement)
- Start working on software ASAP as it is a critical part of our game
- Don't forget to think about all the game endings
- Anticipate the upgrades for the game from the start to avoid re-coding the entire game to bring one little update

WEEK2:
- Add a system to make MIWI robust ( FIFO ?)
- Why not check the integrity of the frames ?
